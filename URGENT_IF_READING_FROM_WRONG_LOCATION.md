# 🚨 URGENT: If You're Reading This and See "Proplytics" in Your Path

## ⚠️ YOU'RE IN THE WRONG LOCATION

If your current directory contains "Proplytics" in the path, you're in the ARCHIVED project.

**Stop immediately and navigate to the correct location.**

## ✅ CORRECT LOCATION

```
/Users/stu/Documents/Bonzai Real Estate App/Active Project/Bonzai-React
```

**Package:** `bonzai-app`

## Quick Fix

```bash
cd "/Users/stu/Documents/Bonzai Real Estate App/Active Project/Bonzai-React"
pwd  # Verify it shows Bonzai path
grep '"name"' package.json  # Should show "bonzai-app"
```
