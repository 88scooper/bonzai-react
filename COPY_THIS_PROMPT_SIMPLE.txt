IMPORTANT: Before starting any work, verify you're in the correct project:

1. Run: pwd
   Must show: /Users/stu/Documents/Bonzai Real Estate App/Active Project/Bonzai-React

2. Run: grep '"name"' package.json
   Must show: "name": "bonzai-app",

Project: Bonzai (bonzai-app)
NOT: Proplytics or proplytics-app

If you see "Proplytics" in the path, navigate to the Bonzai project first.
Confirm you're in the correct project before proceeding.
