# 🚨 FIRST COMMAND TO RUN 🚨

Before doing ANYTHING else, run these commands:

```bash
pwd
grep '"name"' package.json
```

**Expected output:**
```
/Users/stu/Documents/Bonzai Real Estate App/Active Project/Bonzai-React
  "name": "bonzai-app",
```

**If you see "Proplytics" in the path, STOP - you're in the wrong location!**
